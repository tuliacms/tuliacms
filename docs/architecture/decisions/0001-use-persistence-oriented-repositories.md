# CORE - Use persistence-oriented Repositories

Date: 2022-03-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to standarize all repositories, and usage of them. We can treat Repository like collection,
or like persistence-oriented storage.

## Decision

We use persistence-oriented Repositories, with methods: `save()`, `find()`, `delete()`.

## Consequences

None.
